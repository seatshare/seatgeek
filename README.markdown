SeatGeek [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bluefocus/seatgeek.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bluefocus/seatgeek)
========
SeatGeek maintains a canonical directory of live events in the United States. The SeatGeek Platform makes it easy to construct applications that help users find and discover events by exposing the wealth of data and powerful search behind SeatGeek.com in an easy-to-consume format.

This Gem is designed to be a platform agnostic wrapper around the SeatGeek Platform API. Enjoy it and please let me know about anything really cool which uses it.

For more information, including a detailed description of the functionality available, visit [The SeatGeek Platform documentation site](http://platform.seatgeek.com).

**Rubies supported**

- 1.9.2
- 1.8.7

Installation
------------

**With Bundler**
In your Gemfile, add the following line

    gem 'seatgeek', :require => 'seatgeek'

**Without Bundler**

    gem install seatgeek

Usage
-----
At the moment the interface is very simple. I have some additional features and classes planned (see TODO).

NOTE: Unless it is already defined in your application, SG will be defined as a shortcut class to SeatGeek::Connection. Accordingly, you can replace any instance of SeatGeek::Connection with SG (i.e. SG.events)

SeatGeek::Connection is where all the meat is.

Each of the four endpoints can be accessed with a class method reflecting the endpoint's name.

    SeatGeek::Connection.events
    SeatGeek::Connection.performers
    SeatGeek::Connection.taxonomies
    SeatGeek::Connection.venues

Options can be passed in a hash to these methods and they will be included in the request.

    #### Examples mirror documentation at http://platform.seatgeek.com ####
    SeatGeek::Connection.events({:id => 801255})
    # => GET http://api.seatgeek.com/2/events/801255
    SeatGeek::Connection.events({:geoip => 98.213.245.205, :range => 12mi})
    # => GET http://api.seatgeek.com/2/events?geoip=98.213.245.205&range=12mi

SeatGeek::Connection objects can be instantiated before calls. Any parameters passed into the call to #initialize will be passed along with all requests which are generated by that object.

    @sg_50_pp = SeatGeek::Connection.new({:per_page => 50})
    @sg_50_pp.events
    # => GET http://api.seatgeek.com/2/events?per_page=50
    @sg_50_pp.events({:page => 2})
    # => GET http://api.seatgeek.com/2/events?per_page=50&page=2

There are a number of class level options that can be overridden.

    SeatGeek::Connection.adapter          # the Faraday adapter to use (default: :net_http)
    SeatGeek::Connection.logger           # a Logger object for logging requests (default: nil)
    SeatGeek::Connection.protocol         # http or https (default: :http)
    SeatGeek::Connection.response_format  # ruby, json, jsonp or xml (default: ruby)
    SeatGeek::Connection.url              # api.seatgeek.com [Advanced tuning]
    SeatGeek::Connection.version          # 2 [Forward thinking]

Example:

    SeatGeek::Connection.protocol
    # => :http
    SeatGeek::Connection.protocol = :https
    # => :https
    SeatGeek::Connection.events
    # => GET https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events

These options can also be overridden during instantiation of a SeatGeek::Connection

    @secure = SeatGeek::Connection.new({:protocol => :https})
    @secure.events
    # => GET https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events

TODO
----
The following are features planned for later release. I'm happy to take requests and, of course, pull requests.

**Endpoint Classes**
SeatGeek::Events / SeatGeek::Performers / SeatGeek::Venues / SeatGeek::Taxonomies

**Endpoint #all method**
This will loop through the list response until it runs out of results.
